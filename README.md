# This app is DOA

---
Spotify just recerntly updated its developer terms and no longer provides extended api access to devs unless they have 250k MAU
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes

So if you are interested in using this app

1) Clone this repo
2) Create your own app https://developer.spotify.com/
3) Change the callback uri to your github hosted app

# üéµ Camp the Spot ‚õ∫Ô∏è

**A free web app for Spotify users who want to find their favorite artists on Bandcamp.**

---

## Try it: [https://subhyde.github.io/Camp-The-Spot/](https://subhyde.github.io/Camp-The-Spot/)

---

## What is this?
Camp the Spot is a simple tool I made because I wanted an easier way to find my Spotify artists on Bandcamp. If you like collecting music (vinyl, cassettes, CDs, or just digital), this might help you too.

## How does it work?
- You sign in with Spotify.
- The app grabs your liked songs and artists.
- It groups your artists and gives you a link to search for each one on Bandcamp.


## Why?
I got tired of searching for every artist by hand on Bandcamp. This just makes it faster.

## Privacy
- Everything runs in your browser. Nothing is saved or sent anywhere.
- The Bandcamp links just open a search page for the artist.
