## What is this?
Camp the Spot is a simple tool I made because I wanted an easier way to find my Spotify artists on Bandcamp. If you like collecting music (vinyl, cassettes, CDs, or just digital), this might help you too.

## How does it work?
- You sign in with Spotify.
- The app grabs your liked songs and artists.
- It groups your artists and gives you a link to search for each one on Bandcamp.


## Why?
I got tired of searching for every artist by hand on Bandcamp. This just makes it faster.

## Privacy
- Everything runs in your browser. Nothing is saved or sent anywhere.
- The Bandcamp links just open a search page for the artist.
